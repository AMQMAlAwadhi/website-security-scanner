# Vulnerability Findings Summary for Low-Code Platform Security Assessment

## Overview
This document summarizes the identified vulnerability findings from security scans conducted on four low-code platforms: Airtable, Bubble, MERN Stack, and Outsystems. The scans were performed using the UST Professional Security Scanner, and the results are compiled for inclusion in the thesis on comparative security analysis of low-code platforms.

## Methodology

- **Scan Types**: Static analysis, header checks, pattern-based detection
- **Platforms Assessed**: Airtable, Bubble, MERN (Generic), Outsystems
- **Key Metrics**: Risk Score, Total Vulnerabilities, Severity Breakdown, OWASP Compliance

### 3. MERN Stack (Generic)
- **Target URL**: https://mern-ust-project-2026-2.onrender.com/
- **Risk Score**: 13.93/100 (Minimal)
- **Total Vulnerabilities**: 3
- **Severity Breakdown**:
  - Critical: 0
  - High: 0
  - Medium: 1
  - Low: 1
  - Info: 1
- **OWASP Compliance**: 85%
- **Key Findings**:
  - Missing Content Security Policy (Info, Verified): No CSP header found.
  - Missing Clickjacking Protection (Low, Verified): No X-Frame-Options or CSP frame-ancestors.
  - Request URL Override (Medium, Unverified): Potential access-control impact requiring manual verification.

### 4. Outsystems
- **Target URL**: https://personal-7hwwkk2j-dev.outsystems.app/UST/
- **Risk Score**: 29.53/100 (Low)
- **Total Vulnerabilities**: 7
- **Severity Breakdown**:
  - Critical: 0
  - High: 1
  - Medium: 1
  - Low: 2
  - Info: 3
- **OWASP Compliance**: 65%
- **Key Findings**:
  - Session Management Issues (Medium, Unverified): No clear session management implementation.
  - Missing Role-Based Access Control (High, Unverified): No RBAC detected.
  - Missing Security Headers (Info/Low, Unverified): Missing Content-Security-Policy, Clickjacking Protection, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies.

## Comparative Analysis
- **Highest Risk**: Airtable (99.91) with 76 vulnerabilities, primarily medium/low severity.
- **Lowest Risk**: MERN Stack (13.93) with only 3 vulnerabilities.
- **Common Issues Across Platforms**:
  - Missing security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.).
  - Cookie misconfigurations.
  - Client-side data exposure.
  - Platform-specific exposures (e.g., Base IDs in Airtable, workflows in Bubble).
- **Verification Status**: Most findings are tentative/unverified, relying on static analysis. Some verified via header presence checks.
- **OWASP Compliance**: Ranges from 0% (Airtable) to 85% (MERN), indicating varying baseline security implementations.

## Recommendations for Thesis
- **Platform Selection**: MERN Stack shows the best security posture among the assessed platforms.
- **Common Mitigations**: Implement comprehensive security headers, secure cookie configurations, and regular vulnerability scanning.
- **Research Implications**: Low-code platforms require enhanced security controls to mitigate inherent risks like client-side exposures and misconfigurations.
