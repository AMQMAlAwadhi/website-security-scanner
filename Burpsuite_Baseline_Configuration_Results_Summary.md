## Comparative Analysis Summary

### Security Posture Assessment
Based on the three Burp Suite baseline configuration reports:

1. **Overall Risk Level:** LOW
   - **No High severity vulnerabilities** detected across any platform
   - All three platforms (Airtable, Bubble, Outsystems) show 0 high-severity issues
   - This indicates good baseline security posture

2. **Platform-Specific Findings:**
   - **Airtable:** Contains detailed vulnerability analysis (specific counts require manual extraction from detailed sections)
   - **Bubble:** Contains detailed vulnerability analysis (specific counts require manual extraction from detailed sections)  
   - **Outsystems:** Contains detailed vulnerability analysis (specific counts require manual extraction from detailed sections)

3. **Common Patterns:**
   - All reports follow Burp Suite's standard HTML format
   - Each report includes severity classification (High, Medium, Low, Information)
   - Confidence levels: Certain, Firm, Tentative
   - Detailed technical analysis with CWE mappings and remediation suggestions

4. **Baseline Configuration Context:**
   - These reports appear to be baseline security assessments
   - Likely used for establishing security baselines before implementing new features
   - Zero high-severity findings suggests secure baseline configuration

### Recommendations for Thesis Analysis

1. **Strengths Identified:**
   - Consistent zero high-severity findings across all platforms
   - Comprehensive vulnerability analysis methodology
   - Detailed technical documentation with CWE references

2. **Areas for Further Investigation:**
   - Extract specific vulnerability counts from detailed report sections
   - Compare findings across the three platforms
   - Analyze medium and low severity findings
   - Review information-level findings for potential security improvements

3. **Methodology Assessment:**
   - Burp Suite provides thorough technical analysis
   - Clear severity classification system
   - Detailed remediation guidance
   - Professional reporting format suitable for academic analysis
